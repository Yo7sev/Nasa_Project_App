    **Exoplanets**, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system.
    Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, astronomers have identified thousands of exoplanets,
    revealing a wide variety of worlds.

    The oÔ¨Écial number of exoplanets ‚Äî planets outside our solar system ‚Äî confirmed by NASA has reached 6,000. The first exoplanet around a Sun-like star was discovered 30 years ago. Since then, the number has rapidly increased as technologies improve.

Thousands more candidate planets await confirmation, and each confirmed planet enables scientists to learn more about the conditions under which planets can form, how common planets like Earth might be, and where to look for them.

    st.write("""
    **Discovery Methods:**
    - **Transit Method:** Observing the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it.
    - **Radial Velocity (Doppler) Method:** Detecting the star's wobble caused by gravitational pull from an orbiting planet.
    - **Direct Imaging:** Capturing images of exoplanets by blocking out the star's light.
    - **Gravitational Microlensing:** Using the gravitational field of a star to magnify the light of a distant background star.

    - **Hot Jupiters:** Gas giants orbiting very close to their stars.
    - **Super-Earths:** Planets with masses larger than Earth's but smaller than Uranus or Neptune.
    - **Earth-like Planets:** Rocky planets in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist.

    - **TRAPPIST-1:** Seven Earth-sized planets, three in the habitable zone.

    Our eyes in space will grow sharper, begin to scrutinize the atmospheres of extremely distant planets,

    Once light is captured, it can be probed to reveal the composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
    Scientists can read the color bands of this spectrum like a bar code, revealing which molecules are present.
